Note from the same author there is also a paper about differential network: 
- Zhao, B., Wang, Y. S., & Kolar, M. (2022). FuDGE: A method to estimate a functional differential graph in a high-dimensional setting. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23(82), 1-82.

I also found another reference that do something similar to what we want to do: 
- Tugnait, J. K. (2023). Learning High-Dimensional Differential Graphs From Multiattribute Data. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 72, 415-431.
